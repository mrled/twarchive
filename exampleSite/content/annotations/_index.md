title: Tweet annotations
---

Ornithography also supports tweet annotations,
in the form of suggestions and disclaimers.
Suggestions are banners at the top of a tweet,
which mimic Twitter's Home/For You page which suggests tweets based on your follows, interests, etc.
Disclaimers are banners at the bottom of a tweet,
which mimic Twitter's fact-checking.

Here's a regular tweet without a suggestion or disclaimer:

{{< twarchiveTweet "20" >}}

Here's the same exact tweet again, just for testing:

{{< twarchiveTweet "20" >}}

Here's one with a suggestion:

{{< twarchiveTweet "example-suggestion" >}}

Here's one with a disclaimer:

{{< twarchiveTweet "example-disclaimer" >}}
