# Todo

- Rename `twarchiveRoot.scss`; it is only used internally and the name should reflect that.
- Support Twitter archive downloads too
  - Don't ever bother redownloading tweets that are already in a Twitter archive
  - But do download tweets referenced from a Twitter archive (RTs and thread parents)
- Why do I have both `thread_parent_id` and `replyto_tweetid` ??
